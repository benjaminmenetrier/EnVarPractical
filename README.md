# EnVarPractical

Scripts to practice the implementation of EnVar methods.

Goal: implement the different B matrices as full matrices and as sequences of sparse operators, and compare them with Dirac tests

Content:
- Exercise 1: pure sampled covariance matrix
- Exercise 2: localized covariance matrix
- Exercise 3: hybrid covariance matrix

Requires the tools available in "utilities.py".
