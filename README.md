# EnVarPractical

The script `envar_tocomplete.py` should be completed to practice the implementation of EnVar methods:
- Exercise 1: about the pure sampled covariance matrix
- Exercise 2: about the localized covariance matrix
- Exercise 3: about the hybrid covariance matrix

Solutions are available in the script `envar_completed.py`.
Some utilities required in the exercises are provided in `utilities.py`.
